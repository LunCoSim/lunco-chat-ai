## About LLM, Web3, and Space Engineering

With LLMs Space Systems engineering looks more like a conversation, where you discuss the project with LLM and select things that makes sense, formalizing the model

It'll be done in tons of iterations, resulting in a proper documentation, as well as all the required models like CAD, CAM, etc...

As llama3 said:

By integrating LLMs and web3 technologies, the requirements management process for spacecraft can become more efficient, transparent, and accurate, ultimately leading to improved spacecraft design, development, and operation.
